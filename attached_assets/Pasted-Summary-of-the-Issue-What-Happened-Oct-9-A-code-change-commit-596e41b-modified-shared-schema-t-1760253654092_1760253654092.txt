Summary of the Issue
What Happened:
Oct 9: A code change (commit 596e41b) modified shared/schema.ts to add maxOrders column to the plan_settings table
Problem: No database migration was actually run - the databases never got updated
Result: Schema file says "should have max_orders" but databases don't have it
Deployment Error: Replit compares:
schema.ts (your code) ✅ HAS maxOrders defined
Dev database ❌ MISSING max_orders column
Production database ❓ Status unknown
Replit thinks: "Dev doesn't have it, so delete it from production!"
What We've Tried:
✅ Removed old Drizzle migration metadata
✅ Created new baseline with max_orders included
✅ Added max_orders column to dev database
❌ Still getting the error
Why It's Still Failing:
The deployment might be cached or there's another database Replit is checking. Let me verify what's actually in dev now:
                                            Table "public.plan_settings"

    "plan_settings_plan_id_unique" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (plan_id)

Good! Dev database DOES have max_orders now (line 15).
The Real Issue:
Replit's deployment is likely using a cached snapshot of your dev database from before we added the column, OR it's comparing against the old 0000_neat_lake.sql migration baseline.
What We Need To Do:
Option 1: Just approve the deployment (Simplest)
The warning is misleading - it's based on stale data
Approve it, let it sync everything
Run the restoration script if needed
Future deployments will work correctly
Option 2: Force Replit to refresh
Delete the old baseline migration file: migrations/0000_neat_lake.sql
Force Replit to use the new baseline we created
Try deploying again
Which would you prefer? I recommend Option 1 since we've already fixed the actual issue (dev now has max_orders), and the deployment system just needs to catch up.
