Error Handling
When an error occurs during a request, regardless of its severity level, it will be returned as a JSON structure. When implementing the API within your application, you should check for the existance of the error_code property and handle it accordingly. The various error messages you might come across are detailed below.

Additionally, depending on the error type, you may also receive an array of error structures. These structures provide sub-codes and extra details about the error.

Example Error Request
GET /items?item_ids=thisVeryLongItemIDIsTooLong
Example Error Response

    "error_code": 9000,

        {

            "property": "item_ids",
            "subcode": 9004
        }
    ],
