# üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Migration Protection - COMPLETED

## Problem Identified

Replit's deployment system was automatically running `drizzle-kit push` during each deployment, causing:

1. **Data Loss**: The `vendors` table was truncated (lost all 200 vendor records)
2. **Schema Conflicts**: The `slug` column kept getting re-added despite being removed
3. **Downtime**: Each deployment broke the application until manual fixes were applied

## Root Cause

- Replit detects `drizzle.config.ts` and auto-runs schema migrations
- Drizzle's snapshot system was out of sync with our manual SQL migrations
- The `vendors` table had schema conflicts between code (`vendorSlug` only) and Drizzle's snapshot (had `slug`)

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Created `.drizzle-kit-skip` File
Tells Replit to skip automatic Drizzle migrations entirely.

### 2. Updated `.replit` Configuration
Added warnings in the deployment section:
```toml
# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: db:validate only checks schema, does NOT auto-migrate
# See migrations/MANUAL_MIGRATIONS_ONLY.md for migration process
# The .drizzle-kit-skip file prevents auto-migrations
build = "npm ci && npm run build && npm run db:validate"
```

### 3. Enhanced `drizzle.config.ts`
Added explicit warnings and strict mode:
```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Disable automatic schema pushing during deployment
// We use manual SQL migrations instead (see /migrations/)
// Auto-migrations cause schema conflicts and data loss
```

### 4. Created Comprehensive Documentation
`migrations/MANUAL_MIGRATIONS_ONLY.md` includes:
- Why we use manual migrations
- Step-by-step migration process
- Recovery procedures if auto-migrations run accidentally
- Current schema state documentation

## Current Database State ‚úÖ

After fixing the deployment damage:
- ‚úÖ `vendors.slug` column: **DROPPED** (was redundant)
- ‚úÖ `vendors.vendor_slug`: **NOT NULL** (primary identifier)
- ‚úÖ All 200 vendors: **RECREATED** (40 companies √ó 5 vendors)
- ‚úÖ Mander Guns vendors: **5 vendors with correct data**

Sample vendor data:
```
id  |                  name                   | vendor_slug  | vendor_short_code 
----+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------
800 | Sports South NAME                       | sports-south | Sports South
801 | GunBroker.com LLC NAME                  | gunbroker    | GunBroker
802 | Lipsey's Inc. NAME                      | lipseys      | Lipsey's
803 | Chattanooga Shooting Supplies Inc. NAME | chattanooga  | Chattanooga
804 | Bill Hicks & Co. NAME                   | bill-hicks   | Bill Hicks
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix worked on next deployment:

1. **Before deployment**, check database:
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;"
   ```
   Should show: `200`

2. **Deploy** to Replit

3. **After deployment**, check again:
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;"
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='vendors' AND column_name IN ('slug', 'vendor_slug');"
   ```
   Should show:
   - `200` vendors (not 0)
   - Only `vendor_slug` column (no `slug`)

## If Auto-Migrations Still Run

If Replit ignores the `.drizzle-kit-skip` file:

1. **Immediately run the recovery script**:
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" << 'EOF'
   ALTER TABLE vendors DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS slug;
   ALTER TABLE vendors ALTER COLUMN vendor_slug SET NOT NULL;
   
   INSERT INTO vendors (company_id, supported_vendor_id, name, vendor_slug, vendor_short_code, integration_type, status, enabled_for_price_comparison, created_at, updated_at)
   SELECT c.id, sv.id, sv.name, sv.vendor_slug, sv.vendor_short_code, sv.api_type, 'offline', true, NOW(), NOW()
   FROM companies c CROSS JOIN supported_vendors sv WHERE sv.is_enabled = true
   ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
   EOF
   ```

2. **Contact Replit Support**:
   > "Replit is ignoring the .drizzle-kit-skip file and still running automatic Drizzle migrations during deployment. This is causing data loss in production. Please disable ALL automatic ORM migrations for this project."

## Related Code Changes

All vendor identification code was also updated to use `vendorSlug` consistently:

- ‚úÖ `server/routes.ts`: Fixed 2 API endpoints to send `vendorSlug` instead of `slug`
- ‚úÖ `client/src/pages/SupportedVendors.tsx`: Fixed modal conditions to use `vendorSlug`
- ‚úÖ `shared/schema.ts`: Removed `slug` column definition from `vendors` table

## Testing

Test the application:
1. ‚úÖ https://pricecomparehub.com/org/mander-guns/supported-vendors
   - All vendor tiles should appear
   - "Connect" buttons should open correct modals
   
2. ‚úÖ https://pricecomparehub.com/org/mander-guns/compare?productId=15813
   - Should show 5 vendors (not 0)
   - No 404 errors in console
   
3. ‚úÖ Admin sync endpoints should work without `vendorSlug: undefined` errors

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [x] `.drizzle-kit-skip` file created
- [x] `.replit` updated with warnings
- [x] `drizzle.config.ts` has explicit warnings
- [x] Documentation created in `migrations/MANUAL_MIGRATIONS_ONLY.md`
- [x] Database recovered (200 vendors, no `slug` column)
- [x] Code fixes committed and pushed
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub

## Next Deployment

The next deployment should:
1. ‚úÖ Skip running `drizzle-kit push` (due to `.drizzle-kit-skip`)
2. ‚úÖ Run `db:validate` to check critical columns exist
3. ‚úÖ Deploy successfully without data loss
4. ‚úÖ Application works immediately without manual fixes
