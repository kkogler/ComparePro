# Store-Level Bill Hicks Sync Status Display

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Completed

## Overview
Added a "Last Sync" section to the store-level Bill Hicks vendor configuration modal that displays sync statistics, matching the format used in the admin-level vendor sync modals.

## Problem
The store-level Bill Hicks modal at `/org/:slug/supported-vendors` did not display sync statistics like "Added", "Updated", "Skipped", "Failed", and "Processed" records. The admin-level modals at `/admin/supported-vendors` had this information, but it was missing from the store-level view.

## Root Cause
The backend API endpoint `/org/:slug/api/supported-vendors` was fetching Bill Hicks credentials from the `company_vendor_credentials` table but was **not including the sync statistics fields** in the response sent to the frontend, even though these fields were being written to the database during syncs.

## Solution

### 1. Backend Changes (server/routes.ts)
**Lines: 3559-3566**

Added the following sync statistics fields to the API response for Bill Hicks credentials:

```typescript
// Sync statistics for Last Sync section
lastCatalogRecordsCreated: billHicksCredentials.lastCatalogRecordsCreated || 0,
lastCatalogRecordsUpdated: billHicksCredentials.lastCatalogRecordsUpdated || 0,
lastCatalogRecordsSkipped: billHicksCredentials.lastCatalogRecordsSkipped || 0,
lastCatalogRecordsFailed: billHicksCredentials.lastCatalogRecordsFailed || 0,
lastCatalogRecordsProcessed: billHicksCredentials.lastCatalogRecordsProcessed || 0,
catalogSyncError: billHicksCredentials.catalogSyncError || null,
```

These fields are populated by the `updateStoreSyncStatus()` function in `server/bill-hicks-store-pricing-sync.ts` during each sync operation.

### 2. Frontend Changes (client/src/components/BillHicksConfig.tsx)
**Lines: 558-614**

Refactored the "Catalog Sync Status" section to:
- Match the exact format used in admin-level modals
- Remove duplicate status displays
- Display sync statistics in a clean, organized layout:
  - **Status** (Success/Error/In Progress/Never)
  - **Last Sync** (timestamp with timezone)
  - **Statistics** (only shown on successful syncs):
    - Added (green)
    - Updated (blue)
    - Skipped (gray)
    - Failed (red)
    - Processed (total)
  - **Error Message** (only shown when catalogSyncError exists)

## Data Flow

1. **During Sync:** `syncStoreSpecificBillHicksPricing()` in `bill-hicks-store-pricing-sync.ts`
   - Downloads store-specific pricing from Bill Hicks FTP
   - Processes records with differential sync
   - Calls `updateStoreSyncStatus()` with statistics

2. **Status Storage:** `updateStoreSyncStatus()` in `bill-hicks-store-pricing-sync.ts`
   - Updates `company_vendor_credentials` table with:
     - `catalog_sync_status` ('success', 'error', 'in_progress')
     - `last_catalog_sync` (timestamp)
     - `last_catalog_records_created` (added count)
     - `last_catalog_records_updated` (updated count)
     - `last_catalog_records_skipped` (skipped count)
     - `last_catalog_records_failed` (failed count)
     - `last_catalog_records_processed` (total processed)
     - `catalog_sync_error` (error message if failed)

3. **API Response:** GET `/org/:slug/api/supported-vendors` in `routes.ts`
   - Fetches credentials from `company_vendor_credentials` table
   - Includes all sync statistics in response
   - Returns data to frontend

4. **UI Display:** `BillHicksConfig.tsx`
   - Receives vendor data with credentials
   - Displays "Last Sync" section with statistics
   - Conditionally shows metrics only when sync was successful

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to `/org/phils-guns/supported-vendors`
2. Click "Configure" on Bill Hicks & Co.
3. Under "Store Catalog Sync Management", you should now see:
   - **"Last Sync"** section with gray background
   - Status and timestamp
   - Statistics box (if a sync has been successful):
     - Added: X
     - Updated: X
     - Skipped: X
     - Failed: X
     - Processed: X
4. Run a "Manual Sync" to populate the statistics
5. Refresh and verify the numbers update correctly

## Notes

- The UI now matches the admin-level modal format exactly for consistency
- Statistics are only shown when `catalogSyncStatus === 'success'` and `lastCatalogSync` exists
- Error messages are displayed in a red alert box below the statistics
- All database fields use snake_case (`last_catalog_records_created`) while the API response uses camelCase (`lastCatalogRecordsCreated`)
- The sync statistics are updated on every sync operation (success or error)
