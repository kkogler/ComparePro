# CRITICAL SECURITY INVESTIGATION

## Issue Report
User reports seeing Chattanooga results in Vendor Price Comparison for UPC `640420001456` despite NOT having valid working credentials in Store>Supported Vendors>Chattanooga.

This is a **CRITICAL SECURITY VIOLATION** that must be resolved immediately.

## Evidence Found

### 1. UPC Found in Cached Data
The UPC `640420001456` was found in multiple cached Chattanooga CSV files:
- `chattanooga-cache/current-catalog.csv`
- `catalog-cache/chattanooga-catalog.csv`
- `chattanooga-cache/previous-catalog.csv`
- `attached_assets/chattanooga-live-product-feed.csv`
- Multiple Bill Hicks backup files

### 2. Cached Data Infrastructure
The system has extensive Chattanooga caching infrastructure:
- `ChattanoogaCatalogCache` class
- `chattanooga-scheduler.ts` with cache directory
- `catalog-refresh-service.ts` with Chattanooga cache paths

### 3. Possible Security Violations

#### Option A: System Using Cached Data Instead of Real-Time API
- Vendor Price Comparison bypassing store credentials
- Using cached CSV data instead of API calls
- **VIOLATION**: Store-specific pricing not enforced

#### Option B: Master Product Catalog Fallback
- System falling back to imported Master Product Catalog data
- Using admin-imported data instead of store credentials
- **VIOLATION**: Cross-tenant data access

#### Option C: Credential Check Bypass
- Store credential validation not working properly
- API calls happening without valid credentials
- **VIOLATION**: Authentication bypass

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Priority 1)
1. **Disable Chattanooga in Vendor Price Comparison** until this is resolved
2. **Audit all vendor comparison endpoints** for similar issues
3. **Verify no cached data fallbacks exist**

### INVESTIGATION (Priority 2)
1. **Trace the exact code path** for UPC 640420001456 Chattanooga lookup
2. **Verify store credential checks** are actually working
3. **Check for any Master Product Catalog fallbacks**

### FIX (Priority 3)
1. **Remove any cached data fallbacks** from vendor comparison
2. **Enforce strict store credential requirements**
3. **Add logging** to track all vendor comparison API calls

## Security Requirements

### ‚úÖ MUST ENFORCE
- Store credentials REQUIRED for all vendor API calls
- NO fallback to cached data
- NO fallback to Master Product Catalog data
- NO cross-tenant data access

### ‚ùå MUST NOT ALLOW
- Vendor results without valid store credentials

## Test Case
