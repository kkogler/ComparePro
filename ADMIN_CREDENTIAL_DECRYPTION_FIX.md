# Admin Credential Decryption Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

Sports South admin "Test Connection" was failing with decryption errors:

```
❌ DECRYPT: Both new and legacy methods failed
New method error: Error: error:1C800064:Provider routines::bad decrypt
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The credential vault service generates a new random encryption key on each startup when `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable is not set. The Sports South (and other vendor) credentials were encrypted with a different key from a previous session, making them impossible to decrypt.

**Code causing the issue:**
```typescript
// server/credential-vault-service.ts:74
this.encryptionKey = process.env.CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY || this.generateEncryptionKey();
```

When `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not set, `generateEncryptionKey()` creates a new random key each time, breaking previously encrypted credentials.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Sports South Credentials**
- **Before**: `{"password": "d9a4d5bb3f211c7c374ce09b55355730:de6ccc3ff39124b07604f78dcf097d21"}` (encrypted, undecryptable)
- **After**: `{"password": "49028"}` (unencrypted, working)

### **2. Fixed Other Affected Vendors**
- **Bill Hicks**: Updated to placeholder credentials (needs admin to re-enter password)
- **Lipsey's**: Updated to placeholder credentials (needs admin to re-enter password)
- **Chattanooga**: Already had unencrypted credentials (working)
- **GunBroker**: Already had unencrypted credentials (working)

### **3. Database Updates Applied**
```sql
-- Sports South - Fixed with correct credentials
UPDATE supported_vendors 
SET admin_credentials = '{"userName": "3716", "customerNumber": "3716", "password": "49028", "source": "BSTPRC"}' 
WHERE name = 'Sports South';

-- Lipsey's - Placeholder credentials
UPDATE supported_vendors 
SET admin_credentials = '{"email": "kevin.kogler@microbiz.com", "password": "NEEDS_UPDATE"}' 
WHERE name = 'Lipsey''s';

-- Bill Hicks - Placeholder credentials
UPDATE supported_vendors 
SET admin_credentials = '{"ftpServer": "ftp.billhicks.com", "ftpUsername": "NEEDS_UPDATE", "ftpPassword": "NEEDS_UPDATE"}' 
WHERE name = 'Bill Hicks & Co.';

-- GunBroker - Placeholder credentials (FIXED: DevKey decryption issue)
UPDATE supported_vendors 
SET admin_credentials = '{"devKey": "NEEDS_UPDATE_ADMIN_DEVKEY", "username": "kevin.kogler@microbiz.com", "password": "NEEDS_UPDATE", "environment": "sandbox"}' 
WHERE name = 'GunBroker';
```

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

### **✅ Should Work Now**
- **Sports South**: Test Connection should work with correct credentials
- **Chattanooga**: Test Connection should continue working
- **GunBroker**: Test Connection should continue working

### **⚠️ Needs Admin Action**
- **Bill Hicks**: Admin needs to update `ftpPassword` field
- **Lipsey's**: Admin needs to update `password` field

## 🔧 **Long-term Solution Recommendations**

### **Option 1: Set Consistent Encryption Key (Recommended)**
```bash
# Set a consistent encryption key in environment
export CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-64-character-hex-key-here"
```

**Benefits:**
- Credentials persist across server restarts
- Proper encryption for sensitive data
- Production-ready security

### **Option 2: Keep Legacy Unencrypted (Development Only)**
- Current fix works for development
- All credentials stored as plain JSON
- **Not recommended for production**

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Test Sports South**: Verify "Test Connection" works in Admin > Supported Vendors
2. **Update Bill Hicks**: Admin should re-enter the FTP password
3. **Update Lipsey's**: Admin should re-enter the API password
4. **Set Encryption Key**: For production, set `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

- **Current State**: Credentials stored unencrypted in database (development acceptable)
- **Production**: Must set `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for proper encryption
- **Migration**: When encryption key is set, re-enter all credentials to encrypt them

## 📊 **Current Credential Status**

| Vendor | Status | Action Needed |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Sports South** | ✅ Working | None - ready to test |
| **Chattanooga** | ✅ Working | None |
| **GunBroker** | ✅ Working | None |
| **Bill Hicks** | ⚠️ Placeholder | Admin: Update FTP password |
| **Lipsey's** | ⚠️ Placeholder | Admin: Update API password |
