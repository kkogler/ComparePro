# Chattanooga Token Bug Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## 🐛 **The Problem**

You were entering the correct token `A3B1F814A833F40CFD2A800E0EE4CA81` but the system was using a different token `0145d5fa...` causing Error 4001.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

**Multiple credential systems running simultaneously:**

1. **NEW System**: Your token was saved to the credential vault ✅
2. **LEGACY System**: Old token `0145d5fa...` was stored in `company_vendor_credentials` table ❌
3. **CONFLICT**: API calls were using the legacy system instead of the new vault

## 🔧 **What We Fixed**

### 1. **Removed Legacy Fallbacks** 
- **File**: `server/vendor-credential-manager.ts`
- **Change**: Removed fallback to legacy system when new vault is enabled
- **Result**: No more conflicting credential sources

### 2. **Fixed Vendor Price Comparison**
- **File**: `server/routes.ts` (line 2271-2298)
- **Route**: `/org/:slug/api/products/:id/vendors`
- **Change**: Updated to use new credential vault instead of legacy database
- **Result**: Your correct token will now be used for API calls

### 3. **Added Cleanup Script**
- **File**: `cleanup-old-chattanooga-credentials.js`
- **Purpose**: Removes old conflicting credentials from legacy system
- **Usage**: Run to clean up any remaining old data

## ✅ **Expected Results**

After these changes:

1. **Save your token** `A3B1F814A833F40CFD2A800E0EE4CA81` through the Chattanooga config UI
2. **Test connection** - should now work without Error 4001
3. **Vendor Price Comparison** will use your correct credentials
4. **No more token conflicts** between systems

## 🧹 **Optional Cleanup**

To completely remove old conflicting data:

```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace
node cleanup-old-chattanooga-credentials.js
```

This will delete any old Chattanooga credentials from the legacy system.

## 🎯 **System Status**

- ✅ **Single Credential System**: New vault only (no more duplicates)
- ✅ **Consistent Storage**: All saves/loads use same system
- ✅ **No Legacy Fallbacks**: Removed conflicting code paths
- ✅ **Maintainable Code**: Clear, single-purpose credential management

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test your fix**: Save and test Chattanooga credentials
2. **Verify logs**: Should see "Using NEW credential vault" messages
3. **Confirm API calls**: Should use your `A3B1F814A833F40CFD2A800E0EE4CA81` token
4. **No more Error 4001**: Connection should succeed

The duplicate credential systems have been consolidated into a single, maintainable system! 🎉
