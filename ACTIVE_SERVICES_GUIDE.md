## üö´ DISABLED FEATURES

### Cron Schedulers (All Disabled/Removed)
- ~~`bill-hicks-simple-scheduler.ts`~~ (Deleted - sync logic in `bill-hicks-simple-sync.ts`)
- ~~`sports-south-scheduler.ts`~~ (Deleted - sync logic in `sports-south-simple-sync.ts`)
- `chattanooga-scheduler.ts` (Contains sync logic, keep but scheduler disabled)

**Why Disabled:** Reliability issues on the hosting platform  
**Current Solution:** Scheduled Deployments (external automation)  
**Manual Syncs:** Still available via Admin UI

## üìã How to Add a New Vendor Sync

1. **Create sync service file:** `{vendor}-catalog-sync.ts`
2. **Add file header:**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * ‚úÖ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION - {Vendor} Catalog Sync
    * 
    * Active sync implementation for {Vendor}.
    * Used by: routes.ts (manual sync trigger)
    */
   ```
3. **Create schedule routes:** `{vendor}-schedule-routes.ts`
4. **Register in routes.ts:**
   ```typescript
   const { register{Vendor}ScheduleRoutes } = await import('./{vendor}-schedule-routes');
   register{Vendor}ScheduleRoutes(app);
   ```
5. **Add manual sync endpoint** in schedule routes
6. **Update this guide** with the new service
