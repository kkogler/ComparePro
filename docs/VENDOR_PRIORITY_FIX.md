# Vendor Priority System Fix

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed  
**Issue:** Sync system was using wrong priority values

---

## Problem

The vendor priority system had **two separate priority fields** that were out of sync:

1. **`productRecordPriority`** (global, in `supported_vendors` table)
   - Used by sync operations
   - Values: Lipsey's=4, Sports South=1, Chattanooga=2, Bill Hicks=3, GunBroker=5

2. **Retail Vertical Priority** (per-vertical, in `supported_vendor_retail_verticals` junction table)
   - Displayed and edited in Admin UI
   - Values: Lipsey's=1, Sports South=2, Chattanooga=3, Bill Hicks=4, GunBroker=5

**Result:** The UI showed Lipsey's as priority 1, but syncs used priority 4!

---

## Root Cause

The system was created with two priority systems for different purposes:
- Global `productRecordPriority` for overall vendor ranking
- Per-vertical priorities for retail vertical specific rankings (Firearms, Ammunition, etc.)

The sync operations were using the global priority, but the Admin UI was only showing/editing the per-vertical priorities.

---

## Solution

Updated `server/vendor-priority.ts` to use **retail vertical priorities** (Firearms) as the authoritative source:

```typescript
// Query database for vendor and their Firearms retail vertical priority
// Firearms has retail_vertical_id = 1
const [result] = await db
  .select({ 
    vendorId: supportedVendors.id,
    vendorShortCode: supportedVendors.vendorShortCode,
    name: supportedVendors.name,
    productRecordPriority: supportedVendors.productRecordPriority,
    retailVerticalPriority: supportedVendorRetailVerticals.priority
  })
  .from(supportedVendors)
  .leftJoin(
    supportedVendorRetailVerticals,
    and(
      eq(supportedVendorRetailVerticals.supportedVendorId, supportedVendors.id),
      eq(supportedVendorRetailVerticals.retailVerticalId, 1) // Firearms vertical
    )
  )
  .where(
    sql`lower(trim(${supportedVendors.vendorShortCode})) = lower(trim(${vendorSlug})) 
        OR lower(trim(${supportedVendors.name})) = lower(trim(${vendorSlug}))`
  );

// Use retail vertical priority if available (what UI shows)
if (result.retailVerticalPriority !== null) {
  priority = result.retailVerticalPriority;
} else {
  // Fall back to productRecordPriority if no retail vertical mapping
  priority = result.productRecordPriority || DEFAULT_PRIORITY;
}
```

---

## Priority Logic

1. **Primary:** Use retail vertical priority (Firearms) - this is what the UI displays
2. **Fallback:** Use global `productRecordPriority` if no retail vertical mapping exists
3. **Default:** Use 999 if no priority is set at all

---

## Current Priorities

**After Fix (using Firearms retail vertical priorities):**
- **Lipsey's** - Priority 1 (highest) âœ…
- **Sports South** - Priority 2
- **Chattanooga** - Priority 3
- **Bill Hicks** - Priority 4
- **GunBroker** - Priority 5 (lowest)

This now matches what's displayed in the Admin UI!

---

## Impact

### âœ… What Works Now

1. **Sync operations respect UI settings**
   - Lipsey's data will override other vendors (priority 1)
   - Sports South can override Chattanooga, Bill Hicks, GunBroker
   - Priority order matches what admins configure in UI

2. **Image quality upgrades work correctly**
   - Lipsey's (high quality) will replace low quality images
   - Sports South (high quality) will replace low quality images
   - Lower priority vendors won't override higher quality images

3. **Product data updates follow priority**
   - Higher priority vendors can update product fields
   - Lower priority vendors are blocked from overwriting

### ðŸ“Š Data Quality Ranking

**High Quality (Priority 1-2):**
- Lipsey's - Excellent data, high-quality images
- Sports South - Excellent data, high-quality images

**Medium Quality (Priority 3):**
- Chattanooga - Good data, lower-quality images

**Lower Quality (Priority 4-5):**
- Bill Hicks - Incomplete data, variable image quality
- GunBroker - Marketplace data, highly variable

---

## Cache Behavior

The priority cache is cleared when:
- Server restarts
- Manual cache clear via `clearVendorPriorityCache()`
- 5-minute TTL expires

**Current cache behavior:**
```
VENDOR PRIORITY: Cache hit for "lipseys" -> priority 1
```

This log now shows the **correct** priority from the retail vertical!

---

## Testing

Verified priorities after fix:

```bash
$ npx tsx -e "import { getVendorRecordPriority } from './server/vendor-priority'; ..."

VENDOR PRIORITY: Using retail vertical (Firearms) priority 1 for vendor "Lipsey's Inc."
VENDOR PRIORITY: Using retail vertical (Firearms) priority 2 for vendor "Sports South"  
VENDOR PRIORITY: Using retail vertical (Firearms) priority 3 for vendor "Chattanooga Shooting Supplies Inc."
VENDOR PRIORITY: Using retail vertical (Firearms) priority 4 for vendor "Bill Hicks & Co."
VENDOR PRIORITY: Using retail vertical (Firearms) priority 5 for vendor "GunBroker.com LLC"
```

## Files Modified

- `server/vendor-priority.ts` - Updated to query retail vertical priorities

---

## Benefits

1. **âœ… Single source of truth** - Retail vertical priorities (what UI shows) are now used everywhere
2. **âœ… Consistency** - No more confusion between two priority systems
3. **âœ… Flexibility** - Can still have different priorities for different retail verticals in the future
4. **âœ… Transparency** - What you see in the UI is what the sync uses

---

## Why Retail Vertical Priorities?

This was the cleanest fix because:
1. UI already works correctly with retail vertical priorities
2. Most products are in the Firearms vertical anyway
3. Allows for future expansion (different priorities for Ammunition, Accessories, etc.)
4. Less UI changes needed - just backend logic update
5. Maintains existing data - no migrations needed
