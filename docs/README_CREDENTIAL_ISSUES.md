## Current Situation

### What's Working ‚úÖ

- Bill Hicks credentials save and load correctly
- Lipsey's credentials work
- Sports South credentials work  
- Chattanooga credentials work

### Known Technical Debt üî∂

The credential system uses **vendor-specific field aliasing** as a workaround for inconsistent field name handling. This works but requires custom code for each vendor.

**Root Cause:** `processCredentials()` function exists and works perfectly for admin credentials, but is bypassed for store credentials.

## For Developers

### Adding a New Vendor?

If you encounter credential save/load issues with a new vendor:

1. **Check if credentials are in snake_case or camelCase**
2. **Read:** [CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) 
3. **Short-term fix:** Add vendor-specific aliasing in `applyFieldAliases()`
4. **Long-term fix:** Apply `processCredentials()` to store credentials (see documentation)

### Investigating Credential Issues?

**Start here:**
1. Check browser console for credential save/load logs
2. Review `CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` for architecture overview
3. Look at `server/credential-vault-service.ts` lines 382-394 (where fix should go)
4. Compare with admin credential handling (lines 270-287)

## For Stakeholders

### Should We Refactor?

**Questions to consider:**

1. **How often do you add new vendors?**
   - Rarely (1-2/year) ‚Üí Current approach acceptable
   - Frequently (monthly) ‚Üí Refactor recommended

2. **What's the business impact of credential issues?**
   - High ‚Üí Invest in robust solution
   - Low ‚Üí Accept technical debt

3. **When's the next low-pressure period?**
   - Need 2-4 weeks for proper testing
