# Webhook Fixes Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Completed Changes (Ready for Deployment)**

### 1. **Health Check Fix** (`server/monitoring.ts`)
- **Problem**: Health endpoint was returning 503 "unhealthy" when no requests had been processed yet, causing `errorRate: NaN` and `avgResponseTime: NaN`.
- **Fix**: Changed health check to always return `200 OK` with `"status": "ok"` if server is responding. Removed complex "unhealthy" threshold logic that was causing false negatives.
- **Testing**: ✅ Confirmed working - returns proper `null` values for metrics when no requests processed.

```bash
# Test command:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok", ...}
```

---

### 2. **Readiness Endpoint** (`server/routes.ts`)
- **New Feature**: Added `/api/ready` endpoint that validates database connectivity.
- **Purpose**: Separates server health (is it responding?) from readiness (can it serve traffic?).
- **Testing**: ✅ Confirmed working - returns `{"ready":true,"database":"connected"}`.

```bash
# Test command:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/ready
# Expected: {"ready":true,"database":"connected"}
```

---

### 3. **Webhook Payload Normalizer** (`server/zoho-webhook-normalizer.ts`)
- **New File**: Created dedicated normalizer to handle Zoho's varying webhook formats.
- **Features**:
  - Handles event wrapper format (`{ event_type, data: { subscription, customer } }`)
  - Handles direct subscription format (`{ subscription: {...} }`)
  - Derives event type from subscription status if not provided
  - Generates fallback `eventId` using `crypto.randomUUID()` when missing
  - Keeps original `rawPayload` for audit trail
- **Testing**: ✅ Confirmed working - webhook processed with requestId correlation.

---

### 4. **Updated Webhook Route** (`server/routes.ts`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `requestId` for log correlation using `crypto.randomUUID()`
  - Imports and uses `normalizeZohoPayload()` before passing to BillingService
  - Simplified logging to only log keys and derived IDs (no full payloads)
  - Returns `requestId` and `eventId` in success response
- **Testing**: ✅ Confirmed working - received proper response with correlation IDs.

---

### 5. **Updated BillingService** (`server/billing-service.ts`)
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `processZohoWebhook()` to accept normalized payload structure
  - Removed complex payload parsing logic (now handled by normalizer)
  - Uses `normalized.eventType`, `normalized.eventId`, `normalized.subscription`, `normalized.customer`
  - Keeps `normalized.rawPayload` for compatibility with existing code
- **Testing**: ✅ Confirmed working - webhook processed through full flow.

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Push to Git**
```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Republish in Replit**
1. Go to Replit Publishing tab
2. Click "Republish"
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)

### **Step 3: Verify Production Deployment**
```bash
# Test health endpoint (should always return 200 OK now)
curl https://pricecomparehub.com/api/health

# Test readiness endpoint (database connectivity)
curl https://pricecomparehub.com/api/ready

# Test webhook endpoint with actual SUB-00107 data
curl -X POST https://pricecomparehub.com/api/webhooks/zoho \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subscription": {
      "subscription_id": "SUB-00107",
      "customer_id": "4899864000001821594",
      "status": "live",
      "plan": {"plan_code": "free"},
      "customer": {
        "customer_id": "4899864000001821594",
        "display_name": "Menton Firearms",
        "email": "owner@mentonfirearms.com"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## 📋 **Remaining Work (Not Yet Implemented)**

### **Phase 2: Advanced Improvements (Optional)**

These were part of the recommendations but not yet implemented. They can be added later if needed:

1. **Zoho API Repair Logic**
   - Add `zohoBilling.getSubscription()` call to fetch missing data
   - Only call when `subscriptionId` exists but `customerId` or `planCode` are missing
   - Located in: `server/billing-service.ts` - `processZohoWebhook()`

2. **Database Upsert Patterns**
   - Add unique constraints on `companies(billing_provider, billing_customer_id)`
   - Add unique constraints on `subscriptions(billing_provider, external_subscription_id)`
   - Implement `.onConflictDoUpdate()` for idempotent operations
   - Located in: Database schema and `server/billing-service.ts`

3. **Split Core vs. Provisioning**
   - Wrap `provisionCompanyOnboarding()` in try/catch
   - Log provisioning failures but don't fail webhook
   - Located in: `server/billing-service.ts` - `handleSubscriptionCreated()`

4. **Durable Event Logging**
   - Create `billing_events` table with `status` field ('received', 'processed', 'failed')
   - Update status as webhook processes
   - Located in: Database schema and `server/billing-service.ts`

5. **PII-Safe Logging**
   - Remove full payload logging in production
   - Only log keys and derived IDs
   - Add `NODE_ENV` checks for detailed logging
   - Located in: Throughout `server/billing-service.ts` and `server/routes.ts`

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Local Testing (Completed ✅)**
- [x] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [x] Readiness endpoint validates DB connection
- [x] Webhook normalizer handles direct subscription format
- [x] BillingService accepts normalized data
- [x] Request correlation with requestId works

### **Production Testing (After Deployment)**
- [ ] Production health endpoint returns 200 OK (not 503)
- [ ] Production readiness endpoint works
- [ ] Production webhook creates subscription in app
- [ ] Welcome email sent to customer
- [ ] Subscription visible in Admin > Subscriptions

## 📊 **Current Status**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate**: Push to Git and republish in Replit
2. **Verify**: Test production endpoints and resend SUB-00107 webhook
3. **Monitor**: Check if subscription is created and email sent
4. **Phase 2** (if needed): Implement advanced improvements listed above

---

## 📝 **Notes**

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No over-engineering - kept simple and maintainable
- Logging is structured and correlation-friendly
- White screen issue should be resolved (health check fix)
- Webhook processing should now work end-to-end
